# Feature Set

Four non-functional outputs ([Scalability](#earthamericas-scalability), [Connectivity](#link-connectivity), [Acceleration](#zap-acceleration), [Automation](#gear-automation)) that have deriven from functional features are listed below.

#### :earth_americas: Scalability

- **Infrastructure as Code -** automated Kubernetes cluster provisioning
- **Multicluster Orchestration -** manage clouds and robots geographically
- **Container-based -** benefit from the power of virtualization, optimized for the edge

#### :link: Connectivity

- **Built-in VPN (cloud-powered mode) -** access robots securely regardless of their network environment
- **Isolated L2 Networks -** isolating tenants' data and control planes
- **Isolated Robots -** isolating robots by both ROS namespacing and DDS domains

#### :zap: Acceleration

- **Hardware Acceleration -** use hardware acceleration (GPU) for robot simulation, training and virtual desktop environment
- **Virtual Desktop Environment -** use desktop environment to run observability tools
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation -** test, train and simulate robotics applications by updating embedded software remotely

#### :gear: Automation

- **Robot-as-a-Service -** deploying and managing robots and fleets declaratively
- **On-the-Fly Development -** software development using integrated Cloud IDE on runtime
- **Easy Updates -** remotely update the software on your robots
- **Robot Templates -** predefined and reusable robot templates to work with right away
- **Extended Kubernetes API -** extend robolaunch feature set according to your specific needs
