# ROS

[ROS (Robot Operating System)](https://www.ros.org/) is an open-source middleware platform designed to facilitate the development of robotic software. It provides a robust and flexible framework for building complex and distributed robot applications. With ROS, you can easily create and connect various nodes, each responsible for specific tasks, enabling smooth and efficient robot operation.
