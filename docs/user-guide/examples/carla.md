# Carla
[Carla](https://carla.org/) is a cutting-edge open-source simulator for autonomous driving research and development. It provides a realistic and dynamic environment for training and testing self-driving cars, with features such as high-quality graphics, realistic physics, and a variety of urban and rural scenarios.

## Create a Carla Application with Just a Few Clicks
With robolaunch, you can create a Carla application in just a few clicks. No need to worry about installing and configuring Carla on your own machine. robolaunch takes care of everything for you, providing you with a ready-to-use Carla instance in the cloud.
