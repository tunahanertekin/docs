# Deployment Overview

In the robolaunch platform, the term **Deployment** encompasses the distinct use case types that can be developed and managed seamlessly. Two primary categories under the Deployment umbrella are **Namespace** and **Fleet**. Each represents a specific focus area for development, catering to the diverse needs of AI/ML and robotics projects.

## 1. Namespace 
    
_will be added soon..._

## 2. Fleet

Fleet represents a cloud resource that spans both Cloud Instances and Physical Instances. It serves as a centralized hub for seamless integration and coordination between these instances, operating at both ROS 2 and DDS (Data Distribution Service) levels. The Fleet provides a DDS discovery server within the Cloud Instance, establishing robust connectivity and communication channels at the ROS 2 and DDS levels among the connected Physical Instances. This empowers efficient data sharing, collaboration, and discovery within the robotics ecosystem, enhancing the capabilities and functionality of the platform

**Features:**

- **Federated resource:** 
    - Fleet serves as a federated resource, seamlessly integrating Cloud Instances and Physical Instances within the platform.

- **Centralized hub:** 
    - The Fleet acts as a centralized hub for coordination and communication, facilitating seamless integration and collaboration between ROS 2 applications in instances.

- **Connectivity (ROS 2 and DDS):** 
    - Fleet enables connectivity and communication at the ROS 2 level, providing a standardized framework for inter-instance communication within platform.

    - Fleet provisions a DDS (Data Distribution Service) discovery server within the Cloud Instance, establishing robust connectivity and communication channels among connected Physical Instances at the DDS level.

    - Fleet enables efficient data sharing and synchronization between Cloud Instances and Physical Instances, ensuring seamless collaboration and coordination of robotics applications.

    - Fleet simplifies the configuration process by automating the setup and connectivity between Cloud Instances and Physical Instances.

## Conclusion

In summary, the Deployment section in robolaunch serves as a gateway to tailored development experiences. It accommodates the unique requirements of AI/ML and robotics projects, fostering innovation, collaboration, and efficiency within a unified platform.
