## Deletion Flow

![Delete Namespace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robolaunch/trademark/main/repository-media/docs/user-guide/deployment/namespace/img/delete-ns.png)

All you need to delete an namespace is just a few clicks.

- Go to the dashboard where your namespaces are. (You can get there by clicking the instance icon in the sidebar and click the `>` button on any item.)

- Click on the button with the trash icon on the right side of the opened table rows.

- After clicking, confirm the popup that appears.

Finally, the namespace chart will be refreshed. You can view existing namespaces in the displayed table.
