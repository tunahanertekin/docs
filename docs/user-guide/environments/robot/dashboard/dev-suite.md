## Remote Desktop

Remote Desktop allows you to take control of the instance created for your robot as if you were directly interacting with your own computer.

### Display
With Remote Desktop, you can remotely access and control the instance, enabling seamless collaboration with your team. This feature allows you to share the same screen with your teammates, facilitating real-time collaboration. The integrated chat section allows instant communication during the development process.
