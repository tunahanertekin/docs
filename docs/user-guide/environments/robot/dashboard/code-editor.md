# Code Editor

The Code Editor is a robust tool within the Robot dashboard that facilitates the development of projects in designated workspaces, offering a seamless and collaborative coding experience.

## IDE
The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an integral part of the Code Editor, providing a comprehensive workspace for project development within your robot. The IDE ensures a consistent and efficient development process.

The Code Editor promotes teamwork by allowing multiple team members to collaboratively work on projects within shared workspaces. This collaborative approach enhances productivity and fosters innovation.
