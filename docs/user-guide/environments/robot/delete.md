Effortlessly remove a robot from your dashboard by following these simple steps:
- Go to the dashboard where your robots are located. (Access it by clicking the organization icon in the sidebar and then clicking the > button on any item.)
- Identify the robot you wish to delete, and click on the trash icon located on the right side of the corresponding table row.
- Confirm the deletion by responding to the popup that appears.

Upon completion, the robot chart will be refreshed, and you can readily observe the updated list of existing robots in the displayed table. Streamlining the management of your robotics environment has never been more efficient.
