# Code Editor

The Code Editor within the robolaunch platform serves as a powerful tool for developing projects within the dedicated workspaces of your application. This feature is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive coding experience, akin to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

## IDE
The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is an integral part of the Code Editor, facilitating the collaborative development of projects within your application's workspaces. This feature empowers you to work on your projects with your team, fostering collective improvements and innovations.

## Control Bar
The IDE Control Bar offers a suite of controls to manage the IDE Pod effectively. This includes the ability to initiate a soft or hard restart and examine the log of the current service. These functionalities ensure a streamlined development process, enhancing your control and oversight over the coding environment.
