# Remote Desktop

Remote Desktop on robolaunch enables you to seamlessly control the instance created for your application, offering a remote experience comparable to interacting with your local computer.

## Display
Remote Desktop allows you to remotely access and control the instance, fostering collaboration within your team. It provides a shared view of the screen, allowing team members to collaboratively work on the same screen. In addition, the chat section facilitates instant communication among team members during the remote session.

### Control Bar
The VDI Control Bar empowers you to manage the streaming experience effectively. You can take control of the instance, adjust the volume, initiate a soft or hard restart, and even examine the log of the current service, providing comprehensive control over the remote environment.
