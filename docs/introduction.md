# Introduction

# Overview

[robolaunch](robolaunch.io) is a Cloud-Native Robotics Platform that provides the end-to-end infrastructure, software stack and tools for developing, simulating, deploying and operating ROS/ROS2 robots at scale.

robolaunch's end-to-end infrastructure, which we also call it "Unified Robotics", enables robotics developers to develop & simulate robotics applications on cloud via VDI infrastructure that uses GPU power, deploy robotics applications to the physical robots remotely and operate the robot's status in a run-time with management, orchestration and monitoring functionalities.

# Why robolaunch?

Robotics development contains many challenges itself. Such as it requires multi-domain knowledge to build a robot and this process is mostly dependent on expensive hardware. Therefore the process becomes hard to achieve and time consuming as a result.

With robolaunch, we want to give robotics developers the ability to develop, deploy and manage ROS/2 robots easily. One of our primary motivation in developing robolaunch is to remove barriers to entry in robotics development.

robolaunch Cloud Robotics Platform is based on Kubernetes because we believe future of robotics will be a distributed and cloudified system and Kubernetes helps us to provide tenancy, automated deployments and self configuration of work-processes.

We believe that robolaunch will provide great convenience to robotics developers in many ways. We will continue evolving robolaunch with our dedicated team. In the meantime, we hope you to contribute to the codebase so that we can improve robolaunch together.

- **Faster to Getting Started -** eliminates the time spent configuring a development environment locally on personal computer

- **Cost Efficient -** eliminates the costs required for robotics hardware and computational resources

- **Sim-to-Real -** remotely deploy the robotics applications that developed on robolaunch to the physical robot(s)

- **Visualization -** monitor and manage your robots in run time from robolaunch dashboard for a full control over your robots

- **Flexibility -** leverage from entire platform features, or pick the components according to your needs
