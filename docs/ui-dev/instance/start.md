All you need to start an instance is just a few clicks.

- Go to the dashboard where your instances are. (You can get there by clicking the region icon in the sidebar and click the `>` button on any item.)

- Click on the button with the start icon on the right side of the opened table rows.

- After clicking, confirm the popup that appears.

Finally, the instance chart will be refreshed. You can view existing instances in the displayed table.
